Instructions

	1. Clone the repository from github Link: https://github.com/yousss811/cs462mp1.git 
	2. Insert the desired input and preamble into the directory and name them input.txt and preamble.txt respectivly
	3. Run the python code, I use a VScode extention but it can be done through the terminal if desired
	4. The final output will be printed to the stdout 

I believe all functions work but my low pass filter might be giving me incorrect values. I hope this can still get partial credit since majority of the functionality exists. Thanks.
